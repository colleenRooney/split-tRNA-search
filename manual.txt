BRIEF INTRODUCTION

In some organisms, like the archaeal parasite Nanoarchaeum equitans, 
tRNA sequences can be split and widely separated over the whole genome.
Thereby the genes are split into two tRNA-halves after the anticodon-adjacent
position 37, the normal location of tRNA introns.
Split-tRNA-Search is a program to detect such separated and tRNA genes by 
searching both a conserved terminal 5'- and 3' motif of tRNA.
The information that the 3'-region contains a pairing stretch of 7 nucleotides
to a reverse complementary part in the 5'-region (the tRNA's acceptorstem) was
used to identify matching pairs of tRNA-gene halves.
In a first step all matching pairs within a distinct distance arising from
unsplit tRNAs are removed. The remaining 5' and 3' matches are used to predict
possible split tRNAs by similarity of their acceptorstem sequences.
In a second step the resulting sequences can be verified using tRNAscan-SE
(Lowe & Eddy, 1997)


INSTALLATION

The whole package was developed on a Linux platform by use of PHP and the
Virtual Footprint (vfp) pattern matching software which was written in C++.
PHP 4.3 or higher has to be installed.

After unpacking the tarfile, it should be possible to immediately use
Split-tRNA-Search. A vfp binary is included, if it doesn't work try to compile
vfp by starting the shell script:

./compile.sh

Position weight matrices (PWMs) were generated from both a conserved, continuous
3'-region of tRNA genes (nucleotides 54-76) and a 5'-region of tRNA genes
(nucleotides 1-16) in an alignment of over 4000 tRNA genes (taken from
Marck & Grosjean, 2003).

The PWMs generated for archea are part of this package and called 
tDNA1_16.xml and tDNA54_76.xml

Three arguments are necessary:
a 5' and 3'-pattern file (XML formatted) and genome sequence file (FASTA formatted)

Example:
./sts.php -p5 tDNA1_16.xml -p3 tDNA54_76.xml -s Nanoarchaeum.seq

Search parameters can be adjusted by influencing the sensitivity.
Sensitivity is a value between 0-1 and is defined by the fraction of
sequences in the positive dataset that is found at a certain score.
A sensitivity of 1 means that all sequences, that are part of the PWM,
are found whereas a sensitivity of 0.95 means that only 95% are found.
A high sensitivity often results in a high number of matches, therefore
is is better to chose a value slighty lower than 1.
Further improvements concerning the selectivity of a pattern are made
by the introduction of a core which is the most conserved part of a
pattern. Both the core size and core sensitivity can be changed.  

Example:
./sts.php -p5 tDNA1_16.xml -p3 tDNA54_76.xml -s Nanoarchaeum.seq -ms3 0.95 -c3 8

In this example the 3'-pattern features are changes as the PWM sensitivity
is increased to 0.95 and the core size of the 3'-pattern is changed to 8.

The assignment of 5'- and 3' motif to one tRNA can be influenced by the number
of allowed mismatches in the acceptorstem (-m parameter) and minimal and maximal
distance between these two motifs (-min/-max parameter).

The output is FASTA-formatted with the following information in the FASTA ID

match-number, positions, orientation, score, acceptorstem-mismatches 

Examples:
>35,471321-471391,+,37.4,0
>52,331758x327499,-/+,38.61,1

Notes:
- Split-tRNA-genes are indicated with a 'x' between the 5' and 3'-positions.
- The orientations of the two fragments in split-tRNA-genes can be different.
- The score is the sum of scores of the 5'- and 3'-match
